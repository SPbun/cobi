=== COBI ONLY INSTALL ===

You can find a detailed description in the manual, including explainations on how to build the dependencies.

Edit the Makefile.conf according to where the dependencies are installed.

Invoke the following command to build the instrumenter:

make {-j3}

This leaves you with the "cobi" binary, which is everything you need.
